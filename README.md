Drafting ideas for a mobile app about ancient greek learning

Hi! If you're reading this somehow welcome to my first project... Well, first idea of a project.

The general idea of this project is learning Ancient Greek while having fun. I think the app would work even for latin with some adjustments.

Basic things you should know about this project. Take these points as the foundation of the project
1. The app needs to read perfectly the ancient greek characters and its orthography(so stress, punctuaction marks). A simple greek keyboard configuration will work but
not all people have it on their phones, so it should be implemented in app too.
2. GUI has to be simple and user-friendly, given this project is not even a thing right now it should not be a priority.
3. Yes, this is kind of being a duolingo app, though i want to give it a more playful/videogame-like kind of style, where right choices gives you an instant feedback
and rewards you from using things you've already learnt
4. In my brain this app would have a story behind the learning and things like that, but story is the last thing to be added;

I might dump some sketches of how the app would roughly like to give some ideas of the project. We would need some databank given the enormous number of words greek has
(along with noun declension and verb conjugation) from where we can pull out the choices.

If you're reading this in this embryonal state, you are welcome to give your insights(tell me the idea sucks if you want to)
